18/05/2007 was a Tuesday
Months with 30 days: 4, 6, 9, 11
Months with 31 days: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12
February: 28 days and 29 on leap years.
To be a leap year, the year number must be divisible by four
â€“ except for end-of-century years, which must be divisible by 400.
This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not.
2024, 2028, 2032 and 2036 are all leap years.

How many mondays fell on 12th of the month between 1 Jan 1401 and 31 Dec 1800?
