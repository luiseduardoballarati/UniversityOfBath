Database CW1?

Suppose you have been appointed as a Database Manager of an Airlines. The company wants to update the overall IT system.
In this regard, they want you to design a Flight database that holds data regarding different flights, pilots operating
those flights and destinations of those flights. The company would like you to create a program that allows their staff 
members to add and manipulate the database according to changed flight schedules. The program should present a menu with
a list of options in order for the user to interact with the database.

Database built using Flask framework and SQLAlchemy.
